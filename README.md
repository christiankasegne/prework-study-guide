## Description

This prework study guide was a project that introduced me to GitHub workflow.  

## Installation

## Usage
The page provides with few notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. In my opinion, the most helpful part is under the hood, so to speaking. You can open it on chrome, right click on your mouse, select inspect and you can take a look at all the coding that went into this page and if you are a beginner, you can learn a lot from it.
